# Golang implementation of "Introduction to Algorithms"

Algorithms described in the book in pure Go

## Synopsis

This is my official experiment of implementing every (or hopefully the majority) of algorithms and exercises described in the book. I have the 4th edition and will refer to its table of contents.

## Contribution

If you find some more elegant, beautiful, idiomatic or simply fast solution of an implemented algorithm, feel free to create a PR. Any help is welcome.
